Welcome to our Blog! Here, you'll find insights from our work as Data Analysts in the domain of scholarly communication. Particularly, we like to engage with the broader community about how to support data-driven workflows and decision-making around scholarly communication with R.

We are based at the [Göttingen State and University Library](https://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/en/news/), one of the largest academic libraries in Germany. We are using R-based tools in our everyday work and contribute to R package developments and training activities. In this blog, you'll find news and case-studies around:

- Open Access and Open Science Analytics
- R Packages making use of open databases and helping us in our work
- R Tools for interactive visualizations and dashboard developments
- R-related training and outreach activities 

We want to thank [Maëlle Salmon](https://masalmon.eu/) for encouraging us to start a blog about our work. As a technical framework for the blog, we are using [Distill for R Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/), a new web publishing format optimized for scientific and technical writing.
