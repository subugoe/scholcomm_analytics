    <description>Based at the Göttingen State and University Library, 
we are analysing data around scholarly communication using open data and tools.
Here, you'll find insights, and examples of our work. Particularly, we like
to publish case-studies rapidely showing how to support data-driven workflows and 
decision-making around scholarly communication in libraries.

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;On 23 March 2024 &lt;a
href="https://blog.scopus.com/posts/changes-to-scopus-open-access-oa-document-tagging"&gt;Scopus
announced&lt;/a&gt; changes to its open access (OA) tagging policy to better
align with the definitions of Unpaywall, the OA evidence source that
Scopus uses for its bibliometric database. According to the
announcement, these changes affected approximately 2 million items
relative to publisher-provide OA where the OA status has changed from
bronze to hybrid or gold, or from hybrid to gold. Despite this, Scopus
claims that no items previously tagged as OA lost any OA status tags, or
that articles published in closed access wrongly received an OA tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blogpost, I investigate the extent of the OA tagging policy
update using three different Scopus snapshots provided by the &lt;a
href="https://bibliometrie.info"&gt;German Competence Network of
Bibliometrics&lt;/a&gt;. Using a shared corpus of more than 19 million items,
I contrasted the situations before and after the policy changes came
into effect. Results confirm shifts between tags relative to
publisher-provided OA. However, a total of 1,879,531 items lost evidence
about green open access tags. Checking a sample against the Unpaywall
API suggests that these changes were only made on the Scopus side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="data-and-method"&gt;Data and Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To analyse the effects of open access tagging policy changes in
Scopus, I retrieved 19,519,565 items indexed in Scopus that were
published between 2019 and 2023. Data were obtained from the &lt;a
href="https://bibliometrie.info"&gt;German Competence Network of
Bibliometrics&lt;/a&gt; using the Scopus April 2024, July 2024 and October
2024 snapshots. The three snapshots were matched by Scopus item ID to
build a shared corpus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data preparation also involved labelling the &lt;a
href="https://blog.scopus.com/posts/scopus-filters-for-open-access-type-and-green-oa-full-text-access-option"&gt;Scopus
provided open access tags&lt;/a&gt; to allow for comparision across the
snapshots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="78%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="21%" /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class="header"&gt;
&lt;th align="left"&gt;Scopus provided open access tag&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="left"&gt;renamed value&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;publisherfullgold&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;gold&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="even"&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;publisherhybridgold&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;hybrid&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;publisherfree2read&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;bronze&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="even"&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;repositoryvor&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;green (vor)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;repositoryam&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;green (am)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="even"&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;NULL&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;none&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases items did not have any open access tag assigned in one
or several of the investigated snapshots. The respective entries had
&lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; values in the open access status column. Those were
renamed to &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; in order to keep the values during data
transformation and analysis. The differentiation between the two
available green open access tags indicates the manuscript version
published, where &lt;strong&gt;vor&lt;/strong&gt; stands for version of record and
&lt;strong&gt;am&lt;/strong&gt; stands for accepted manuscript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="results"&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Scopus recorded open access tags for approximately 46% of
the publications it indexed between 2019 and 2023. The following table
shows that the number and proportion of open access is consistent across
the three snapshots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Scopus records representing journal articles published between
2019 and 2023 with open access evidence across three different database
snapshots.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class="header"&gt;
&lt;th align="left"&gt;Snapshot&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="left"&gt;Records with OA tag&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="left"&gt;Share (in %)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;April 24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;8,975,035&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;45.98&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="even"&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;July 24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;8,959,215&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;45.90&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;October 24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;8,943,508&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;45.82&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The barplot below illustrates the distribution of open access tags
for each of the three snapshots. Item numbers with a bronze open access
tag declined between the April and the July snapshots, while the number
of items with a gold open access tag increased. These changes are in
accordance with the Scopus announcement. However, the number of items
tagged as green open access dropped between the April and July snapshots
without this being offset by any other OA type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="scp_barplot_interactive.html" seamless="seamless" scrolling="no" frameBorder="0" height="700" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore possible shifts between OA categories, the sankey plot
shows the flows between snapshots, i.e. the number of tags assigned
between snapshots. Like Unpaywall, Scopus assigns multiple open access
tags to a single item in case more than one open access location could
be found. For the 19,519,565 items analysed here, the number of open
access tags per item varied between none and three; nodes titled
&lt;em&gt;Missing&lt;/em&gt; indicate items where this number of tags varied between
snapshots for the same item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="scp_sn.html" seamless="seamless" scrolling="no" frameBorder="0" height="600" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a notable change relative to publisher-provided OA: 386,876
items with a bronze open access tag in the April snapshot were tagged
with a gold open access tag in the July snapshot, which accounts for
most of the bronze status changes. This suggests an improved
identification of full OA journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also substantial changes regarding repository-provided OA can be
observed: Comparing the April and July snapshots (see green highlighted
flows on the left in the sankey plot), a total of 1,329,606 items with
one of the green open access tags in the April snapshot lost this status
in the July snapshot. This number decreases to 549,925 when comparing
the July and October snapshots (see green highlighted flows on the right
in Figure sankey plot).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although items did not lost their open access status through the
changes of the tagging policy, my analysis found a decrease of evidence
for copies in repositories as indicate by the tags
&lt;code&gt;green (am)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;green (vor)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand this difference, I took two samples of 10,000
DOIs representing items loosing green open access status between the
April and July or July and October snapshots and queried the Unpaywall
API to retrieve open access status information for these DOIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between the April and July snapshots, Unpaywall recorded a green open
access version for 85%. Furthermore, Unpaywall assigned green as primary
open access status to 3.4%. Comparing the July and October snapshots
samples shows a similar result: Unpaywall found a repository copy for
85%. Here, Unpaywall assigned green as primary open access status to
2.5% of the investigated items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the number of articles for which Unpaywall identified a
repository copy decreased slightly between the two comparisons, in most
cases Unpaywall tracked a copy in a repository. The analysis suggests
that the underlying reason for the absence of green OA tags in Scopus
cannot be explained by changes in the Unpaywall data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, after manually checking the raw data used to populate
the bibliometrics database of the &lt;a
href="https://bibliometrie.info"&gt;German Competence Network of
Bibliometrics&lt;/a&gt; and the Scopus online database, I was unable to detect
any errors that could explain the decline in green open access evidence
in Scopus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="discussion"&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent changes to the Scopus open access tagging policy are not fully
consistent with Scopus documentation. Examining a shared corpus of
around 20 million records representing journal articles between 2019 and
2023, the results suggest that green open access evidence was removed
from Scopus after the policy changes were introduced, affecting around 2
million records. This decline cannot be explained by changes to
Unpaywall, the source of open access evidence used by Scopus. Although
the overall share of open access remained constant over the three
snapshots examined, analyses of open access that include green open
access need to take these changes into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="code-availability"&gt;Code availability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code used for data preparation, analysis and visualisation is
available on &lt;a
href="https://github.com/doerners/scp_green_oa"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="appendix" id="update-january-2025"&gt;Update January 2025&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our enquiry with Elsevier has confirmed that there was a problem with
the Unpaywall Data Matcher in Scopus. This has been resolved so that the
number of green OA tags increased to the correct value in December
2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="r distill-force-highlighting-css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

      <description>Identifying suitable types of journal articles for bibliometric analyses is important. In this blog post, I present a document type classifier that helps to identify research contributions like original research articles using Crossref and OpenAlex. The classifier and classified OpenAlex records are openly available.</description>

      <description>In June 2024, we published a preprint on the classification of document types in OpenAlex and compared it with the scholarly databases Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed and Semantic Scholar. In this follow-up study, we want to investigate further developments in OpenAlex and compare the results with the proprietary databases Scopus and Web of Science.</description>

      <description>We investigated OpenAlex and found over four million records with incompatible metadata about open access works. To illustrate this issue, we applied Unpaywall's methodology to OpenAlex data. The comparative analysis revealed a shift, with over one million journal articles published in 2023 that were previously labelled as "closed" in OpenAlex, being reclassified as "gold", "hybrid", "green", or "bronze".</description>

      <title>Mining and analysing invoice data from Elsevier relative to hybrid open access</title>
      <dc:creator>Najko Jahn</dc:creator>
      <link>https://subugoe.github.io/scholcomm_analytics/posts/elsevier_invoice</link>
      <description>Publishers rarely make publication fee spending for hybrid journals transparent. Elsevier is a remarkable exception, as the publisher provides open and machine-readable data relative to its central invoicing with funding bodies and fee waivers at the article level. This blogpost illustrates how to mine Elsevier full-texts for these data with the data science tool R and presents new insights by analysing the resulting dataset: of 70,657 articles published open access in 1,753 hybrid journals from 2015 to date, around one third of the publication fees were paid through central agreements. Nevertheless, the majority of funding sources for hybrid open access remains unclear.</description>

      <link>https://subugoe.github.io/scholcomm_analytics/posts/unpaywall_evidence</link>
      <description>We investigated more than 31 million scholarly journal articles published between 2008 and 2018 that are indexed in Unpaywall, a widely used open access discovery tool. Using Google BigQuery and R, we determined over 11.6 million journal articles with open access full-text links in Unpaywall, corresponding to an open access share of 37 %. Our data analysis revealed various open access location and evidence types, as well as large overlaps between them, raising important questions about how to responsibly re-use Unpaywall data in bibliometric research and open access monitoring.</description>
