Part I\n\n\nThis blog post series explores the question whether and how metadata from Semantic Scholar can be used to enrich references in OpenAlex. In the first of two blog posts, I will compare the reference numbers in Semantic Scholar with those in OpenAlex. Analysing over 37 million journal articles between 2015 and 2023, I found strong evidence of potential benefits from integrating reference data from Semantic Scholar into OpenAlex.\n\n\n\n\n\nOct 14, 2025\n\n\nNick Haupka\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost With Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSep 25, 2025\n\n\nHarlow Malloc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome To My Blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSep 22, 2025\n\n\nTristan O’Malley\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 9, 2025\n\nNajko Jahn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing Open Metadata about Transformative Agreements\n\nThis post presents a new dataset that combines open metadata from the cOAlition S Journal Checker Tool and OpenAlex to analyse transformative agreements. Data on these much-discussed agreements are scattered across different sources and are only partially available. To address this, we preserved and combined open metadata from the cOAlition S Journal Checker Tool and OpenAlex, resulting in a unified dataset for large-scale bibliometric studies.\n\n\n\n\n\nDec. 16, 2024\n\nSophia Dörner\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges in evidence for green open access in Scopus\n\nIn March 2024, Scopus announced changes to its open access tagging policy to better align with the Unpaywall definitions. In this blog post, I examine the impact of the policy change by comparing three Scopus snapshots, comprising around 20 million records. Although the overall share of open access did not change, the analysis found a decrease in the number of copies in repositories, affecting about 2 million items, that cannot be explained by Unpaywall changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nOct. 24, 2024\n\nNick Haupka\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying journal article types in OpenAlex\n\nIdentifying suitable types of journal articles for bibliometric analyses is important. In this blog post, I present a document type classifier that helps to identify research contributions like original research articles using Crossref and OpenAlex. The classifier and classified OpenAlex records are openly available.\n\n\n\n\n\nSept. 4, 2024\n\nNick Haupka\nSophia Dörner\nNajko Jahn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent Changes in Document type classification in OpenAlex compared to Web of Science and Scopus\n\nIn June 2024, we published a preprint on the classification of document types in OpenAlex and compared it with the scholarly databases Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed and Semantic Scholar. In this follow-up study, we want to investigate further developments in OpenAlex and compare the results with the proprietary databases Scopus and Web of Science.\n\n\n\n\n\nNov. 7, 2023\n\nNajko Jahn\nNick Haupka\nAnne Hobert\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysing and reclassifying open access information in OpenAlex\n\nWe investigated OpenAlex and found over four million records with incompatible metadata about open access works. To illustrate this issue, we applied Unpaywall's methodology to OpenAlex data. The comparative analysis revealed a shift, with over one million journal articles published in 2023 that were previously labelled as \"closed\" in OpenAlex, being reclassified as \"gold\", \"hybrid\", \"green\", or \"bronze\".\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 7, 2022\n\nNajko Jahn\nNick Haupka\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow open are hybrid journals included in nationwide transformative agreements in Germany?\n\nWe present hoaddata, an experimental R package that combines open scholarly data from the German Open Access Monitor, Crossref and OpenAlex. Using this package, we illustrate the progress made in publishing open access content in hybrid journals included in nationwide transformative agreements in Germany across journal portfolios and countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 7, 2020\n\nNajko Jahn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing and analysing the OpenAIRE Research Graph data dumps\n\nThe OpenAIRE Research Graph provides a wide range of metadata about grant-supported research publications. This blog post presents an experimental R package with helpers for splitting, de-compressing and parsing the underlying data dumps. I will demonstrate how to use them by examining the compliance of funded projects with the open access mandate in Horizon 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 30, 2020\n\nNick Haupka\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring the Open Access Evidence Base in Unpaywall with Python\n\nOpen Access evidence sources constantly change. In this blog post, I present a Python based approach for analysing the most recent snapshots from the open access discovery service Unpaywall. Results shows a growth in open access content, partly because of newly introduced evidence sources like Semantic Scholar.\n\n\n\n\n\nNov. 25, 2019\n\nNajko Jahn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMining and analysing invoice data from Elsevier relative to hybrid open access\n\nPublishers rarely make publication fee spending for hybrid journals transparent. Elsevier is a remarkable exception, as the publisher provides open and machine-readable data relative to its central invoicing with funding bodies and fee waivers at the article level. This blogpost illustrates how to mine Elsevier full-texts for these data with the data science tool R and presents new insights by analysing the resulting dataset: of 70,657 articles published open access in 1,753 hybrid journals from 2015 to date, around one third of the publication fees were paid through central agreements. Nevertheless, the majority of funding sources for hybrid open access remains unclear.\n\n\n\n\n\nOct. 24, 2019\n\nNajko Jahn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterfacing the PID Graph with R\n\nThe PID Graph from DataCite interlinks persistent identifiers (PID) in research. In this blog post, I will present how to interface this graph using the DataCite GraphQL API with R. To illustrate it, I will visualise the research information network of a  person.\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 7, 2019\n\nNajko Jahn\nAnne Hobert\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Access Evidence in Unpaywall\n\nWe investigated more than 31 million scholarly journal articles published between 2008 and 2018 that are indexed in Unpaywall, a widely used open access discovery tool. Using Google BigQuery and R, we determined over 11.6 million journal articles with open access full-text links in Unpaywall, corresponding to an open access share of 37 %. Our data analysis revealed various open access location and evidence types, as well as large overlaps between them, raising important questions about how to responsibly re-use Unpaywall data in bibliometric research and open access monitoring."

Elsevier is a remarkable exception, as the publisher provides open and machine-readable data relative to its central invoicing with funding bodies and fee waivers at the article level. This blogpost illustrates how to mine Elsevier full-texts for these data with the data science tool R and presents new insights by analysing the resulting dataset: of 70,657 articles published open access in 1,753 hybrid journals from 2015 to date, around one third of the publication fees were paid through central agreements. Nevertheless, the majority of funding sources for hybrid open access remains unclear.\nRead more"

    "text": "Data and Method\nThe following analysis is based on data from OpenAlex (Snapshot 08/2025) and Semantic Scholar (Snapshot 02/2025). Data was accessed via the data warehouse of the SUB Göttingen which is powered by Google BigQuery.\nThe present study focuses on articles and reviews in journals. For convenience, journal items were only filtered by the document and publication type from OpenAlex. In addition, the publication year from OpenAlex was used. Journal items were matched via the Digital Object Identifier (DOI). The analysis covers journal items from 2015 to 2023. To obtain the number of references from the respective data sources, the precomputed field was used (for example in Semantic Scholar: ‘referencecount’). However, sometimes the precalculated number may differ from the actual number of references contained in a database. For example, a journal article has a reference count of 18, but all references are missing in the database because the publisher decided to omit this information. In this case, I have to calculate the so-called source reference count.\nThe source reference count in Semantic Scholar was retrieved by counting items in the field ‘references’ that refer to other items within Semantic Scholar. Unlike the reference count, the actual references from Semantic Scholar are not contained in the data warehouse of the SUB Göttingen, but in an external dataset (available through the Semantic Scholar Datasets API). Because the Semantic Scholar reference dataset is quite large (about 1 TB), I made use of the High Performance Cluster of the GWDG Göttingen to calculate the number of source references. For this purpose, I wrote a Python script that performs this task. The aggregated data was then loaded into BigQuery. Retrieving the source reference count in OpenAlex is far simpler, as OpenAlex only considers the source reference count (field: ‘referenced_works_count’)."

    "text": "Results\nFigure 1a displays a comparison of reference counts in Semantic Scholar and OpenAlex for the publication years 2015 to 2023, based on a shared corpus of approximately 37,5 million journal articles. Reference counts precalculated by Semantic Scholar are shown with a dashed line. It can be seen that the precalculated reference count in Semantic Scholar exceeds the number counted in OpenAlex for the publication years 2015 to 2019, but drops slightly afterwards. The number of source references in Semantic Scholar is lower across all publication years than in OpenAlex. In total, 982,585,826 references were counted in OpenAlex and 994,263,247 references were precalculated in Semantic Scholar. The number of source references in Semantic Scholar totals 896,752,043. Note that, although OpenAlex appears to have a greater number of source references than Semantic Scholar, I found about 9 million journal articles with more source references in Semantic Scholar than in OpenAlex (for the chosen time period).\nIn contrast to Figure 1a, Figure 1b shows a comparison of average reference counts in Semantic Scholar and OpenAlex. Again, reference counts precalculated by Semantic Scholar are shown with a dashed line. While the figure shows the same trends as in Figure 1a, a slight decline in the average reference figures can be observed from 2021 onwards. On average, OpenAlex counts 25.52 references per journal item, while Semantic Scholar counts 25.83 references and 23.29 source references per article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of references in OpenAlex and Semantic Scholar based on a shared corpus.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to examine the differences between Semantic Scholar and OpenAlex in more detail, I will assign the precalculated reference and source reference count to publishers (see Figure 3a and 3b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Comparison of references per publisher in Semantic Scholar and OpenAlex.\n\n\n\n\n\nI also compiled a list of the most common publishers for which OpenAlex or Semantic Scholar has a larger source reference count (see Table 1 and 2). Here, it can be seen that OpenAlex deposits more source references for the publishers Elsevier (about 12.600.000 references), Springer (about 916.000 references) and Wiley (about 746.000 references) than Semantic Scholar. On the contrary, Semantic Scholar has more source references for the publishers Frontiers Media (about 800.000 references), SAGE (about 512.000 references) and Taylor & Francis (about 269.000 references).\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: The 10 most frequently appearing publishers for which OpenAlex has a higher source reference count than Semantic Scholar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noal_source_ref_sum\ns2_source_ref_sum\npublisher_id\npublisher_name\ndiff\n\n\n\n\n221,098,550\n208,460,916\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310320990\nElsevier BV\n12,637,634\n\n\n58,524,445\n46,853,039\nNone\nNone\n11,671,406\n\n\n91,912,174\n82,755,155\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310319900\nSpringer Science+Business Media\n9,157,019\n\n\n75,121,716\n67,664,721\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310320595\nWiley\n7,456,995\n\n\n25,816,934\n21,628,791\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310320006\nAmerican Chemical Society\n4,188,143\n\n\n18,203,600\n14,255,451\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310320556\nRoyal Society of Chemistry\n3,948,149\n\n\n19,562,074\n15,847,098\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310311648\nOxford University Press\n3,714,976\n\n\n9,996,522\n6,651,643\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310320261\nAmerican Physical Society\n3,344,879\n\n\n17,313,110\n15,205,127\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310320256\nBioMed Central\n2,107,983\n\n\n15,143,213\n13,396,255\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310319965\nSpringer Nature\n1,746,958\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: The 10 most frequently appearing publishers for which Semantic Scholar has a higher source reference count than OpenAlex (surplus represented by a minus)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noal_source_ref_sum\ns2_source_ref_sum\npublisher_id\npublisher_name\ndiff\n\n\n\n\n27,245,366\n28,043,664\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310320527\nFrontiers Media\n-798,298\n\n\n6,050,726\n6,629,422\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310319811\nEmerald Publishing Limited\n-578,696\n\n\n19,780,360\n20,292,611\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310320017\nSAGE Publishing\n-512,251\n\n\n707,064\n1,069,281\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310320466\nOMICS Publishing Group\n-362,217\n\n\n38,428,778\n38,697,631\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310320547\nTaylor & Francis\n-268,853\n\n\n349,881\n612,388\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310320855\nSciencedomain International\n-262,507\n\n\n6,447,765\n6,696,983\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310319869\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\n-249,218\n\n\n1,507,041\n1,719,281\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310319798\nAssociation for Computing Machinery\n-212,240\n\n\n1,493,723\n1,655,240\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310317820\nKarger Publishers\n-161,517\n\n\n2,069,755\n2,221,403\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310320000\nThieme Medical Publishers (Germany)\n-151,648\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, I will compare the reference and source reference count in Semantic Scholar and OpenAlex by using topics from OpenAlex (see Table 3 and Table 4). I choose the primary topic domain for this purpose (which comprises the domains Health Sciences, Social Sciences, Life Sciences and Physical Sciences). For health sciences, Semantic Scholar counts on average 22,4 source references per article, while OpenAlex counts 23,9 source references. This differs slightly from the precomputed references count, where Semantic Scholar exceeds the reference count of OpenAlex by 24,1 to 23,9 references. The same applies to the social sciences, where the number of references precalculated by Semantic Scholar is greater than in the case of OpenAlex. However, when looking at the average number of source references, OpenAlex surpasses Semantic Scholar (16,0 to 14,5 source references on average).\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: References contained in OpenAlex and precalculated by Semantic Scholar per OpenAlex domain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noal_ref_sum\noal_ref_avg\ns2_ref_sum\ns2_ref_avg\nprimary_topic\n\n\n\n\n191,680,092\n36.625827\n190,953,855\n36.487059\nLife Sciences\n\n\n235,953,838\n23.902660\n237,839,461\n24.093678\nHealth Sciences\n\n\n407,198,668\n31.643654\n400,246,309\n31.103382\nPhysical Sciences\n\n\n145,744,398\n16.035306\n163,572,762\n17.996845\nSocial Sciences\n\n\n2,008,830\n1.398958\n1,650,860\n1.149666\nNone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Source references contained in OpenAlex and Semantic Scholar per OpenAlex domain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noal_source_ref_sum\noal_source_ref_avg\ns2_source_ref_sum\ns2_source_ref_avg\nprimary_topic\n\n\n\n\n191,680,092\n36.625827\n177,680,421\n33.950799\nLife Sciences\n\n\n235,953,838\n23.902660\n221,164,605\n22.404477\nHealth Sciences\n\n\n407,198,668\n31.643654\n364,822,452\n28.350572\nPhysical Sciences\n\n\n145,744,398\n16.035306\n132,044,159\n14.527958\nSocial Sciences\n\n\n2,008,830\n1.398958\n1,040,406\n0.724543\nNone"

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis analysis demonstrates interesting differences between the reference counts in OpenAlex and Semantic Scholar. In particular, discrepancies were found between publishers, with Semantic Scholar counting more references than OpenAlex for publishers like Taylor & Francis and BMJ. The proportion of source references is higher in OpenAlex than in Semantic Scholar, although about 9 million journal articles were identified for which the source reference count was greater than in OpenAlex. This finding is quite relevant for bibliometric research, as it may enable more accurate citation analysis in OpenAlex, which can be achieved through the inclusion of open metadata.\nDuring my analysis, I also discovered some inconsistencies between the Semantic Scholar website and its API. For example, references for some journal articles are missing in the API but are shown on the website. In other cases, references are missing in the API with the note: “Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {‘references’}”. However, this observation was not analysed further.\nIn part II of this blog post series, I will explore how references from OpenAlex can be linked, deduplicated and enriched with references from Semantic Scholar. This post will be published soon!"
