An analysis of over 13 million articles published by major commercial publishers between 2018 and 2025 suggests that this is probably because publishers have not provided Crossref with sufficient affiliation metadata. However, technical issues also seem to have occurred during the transition to Walden, the new version of OpenAlex. Elsevier, the largest publisher, stands out in particular.\n    \n    \n  \n    \n    \n    \n      Oct 27, 2025\n      \n        Nick Haupka\n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Is Semantic Scholar suitable for enriching references in OpenAlex?\n      \n      This blog post explores the question whether metadata from Semantic Scholar can be used to enrich references in OpenAlex. To do this, I will compare the reference numbers in Semantic Scholar with those in OpenAlex. Analysing over 37 million journal articles between 2015 and 2023, I found strong evidence of potential benefits from integrating reference data from Semantic Scholar into OpenAlex.\n    \n    \n  \n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 9, 2025\n\nNajko Jahn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing Open Metadata about Transformative Agreements\n\nThis post presents a new dataset that combines open metadata from the cOAlition S Journal Checker Tool and OpenAlex to analyse transformative agreements. Data on these much-discussed agreements are scattered across different sources and are only partially available. To address this, we preserved and combined open metadata from the cOAlition S Journal Checker Tool and OpenAlex, resulting in a unified dataset for large-scale bibliometric studies.\n\n\n\n\n\nDec. 16, 2024\n\nSophia Dörner\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges in evidence for green open access in Scopus\n\nIn March 2024, Scopus announced changes to its open access tagging policy to better align with the Unpaywall definitions. In this blog post, I examine the impact of the policy change by comparing three Scopus snapshots, comprising around 20 million records. Although the overall share of open access did not change, the analysis found a decrease in the number of copies in repositories, affecting about 2 million items, that cannot be explained by Unpaywall changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nOct. 24, 2024\n\nNick Haupka\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying journal article types in OpenAlex\n\nIdentifying suitable types of journal articles for bibliometric analyses is important. In this blog post, I present a document type classifier that helps to identify research contributions like original research articles using Crossref and OpenAlex. The classifier and classified OpenAlex records are openly available.\n\n\n\n\n\nSept. 4, 2024\n\nNick Haupka\nSophia Dörner\nNajko Jahn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent Changes in Document type classification in OpenAlex compared to Web of Science and Scopus\n\nIn June 2024, we published a preprint on the classification of document types in OpenAlex and compared it with the scholarly databases Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed and Semantic Scholar. In this follow-up study, we want to investigate further developments in OpenAlex and compare the results with the proprietary databases Scopus and Web of Science.\n\n\n\n\n\nNov. 7, 2023\n\nNajko Jahn\nNick Haupka\nAnne Hobert\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysing and reclassifying open access information in OpenAlex\n\nWe investigated OpenAlex and found over four million records with incompatible metadata about open access works. To illustrate this issue, we applied Unpaywall's methodology to OpenAlex data. The comparative analysis revealed a shift, with over one million journal articles published in 2023 that were previously labelled as \"closed\" in OpenAlex, being reclassified as \"gold\", \"hybrid\", \"green\", or \"bronze\".\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 7, 2022\n\nNajko Jahn\nNick Haupka\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow open are hybrid journals included in nationwide transformative agreements in Germany?\n\nWe present hoaddata, an experimental R package that combines open scholarly data from the German Open Access Monitor, Crossref and OpenAlex. Using this package, we illustrate the progress made in publishing open access content in hybrid journals included in nationwide transformative agreements in Germany across journal portfolios and countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 7, 2020\n\nNajko Jahn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing and analysing the OpenAIRE Research Graph data dumps\n\nThe OpenAIRE Research Graph provides a wide range of metadata about grant-supported research publications. This blog post presents an experimental R package with helpers for splitting, de-compressing and parsing the underlying data dumps. I will demonstrate how to use them by examining the compliance of funded projects with the open access mandate in Horizon 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 30, 2020\n\nNick Haupka\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring the Open Access Evidence Base in Unpaywall with Python\n\nOpen Access evidence sources constantly change. In this blog post, I present a Python based approach for analysing the most recent snapshots from the open access discovery service Unpaywall. Results shows a growth in open access content, partly because of newly introduced evidence sources like Semantic Scholar.\n\n\n\n\n\nNov. 25, 2019\n\nNajko Jahn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMining and analysing invoice data from Elsevier relative to hybrid open access\n\nPublishers rarely make publication fee spending for hybrid journals transparent. Elsevier is a remarkable exception, as the publisher provides open and machine-readable data relative to its central invoicing with funding bodies and fee waivers at the article level. This blogpost illustrates how to mine Elsevier full-texts for these data with the data science tool R and presents new insights by analysing the resulting dataset: of 70,657 articles published open access in 1,753 hybrid journals from 2015 to date, around one third of the publication fees were paid through central agreements. Nevertheless, the majority of funding sources for hybrid open access remains unclear.\n\n\n\n\n\nOct. 24, 2019\n\nNajko Jahn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterfacing the PID Graph with R\n\nThe PID Graph from DataCite interlinks persistent identifiers (PID) in research. In this blog post, I will present how to interface this graph using the DataCite GraphQL API with R. To illustrate it, I will visualise the research information network of a  person.\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 7, 2019\n\nNajko Jahn\nAnne Hobert\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Access Evidence in Unpaywall\n\nWe investigated more than 31 million scholarly journal articles published between 2008 and 2018 that are indexed in Unpaywall, a widely used open access discovery tool. Using Google BigQuery and R, we determined over 11.6 million journal articles with open access full-text links in Unpaywall, corresponding to an open access share of 37 %. Our data analysis revealed various open access location and evidence types, as well as large overlaps between them, raising important questions about how to responsibly re-use Unpaywall data in bibliometric research and open access monitoring."

    "section": "Results",
    "text": "Results\nOverall, this investigation covers 13,462,902 journal articles published between 2018 and 2025 in journals covered by transformative agreements the BIBSAM consortium negotiated with 25 publishers, including the largest commercial publishers Elsevier, Springer Nature, and Wiley.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 – Availability of institution entity in OpenAlex works by snapshot. Note that only journals included in current transformative agreements negotiated by the Swedish BIBSAM consortium were investigated.\n\n\nFigure 1 shows the affiliation metadata availability in OpenAlex by year and snapshot. Figure 1A highlights a massive decrease from 2024 onwards. While in 2023, 95% of records (n = 1,665,864) contained specific institution metadata, it decreased to 61% (n = 924,034), according to the September 2025 snapshot.\nIn Walden the decrease is even more pronounced: from 84% of records in 2023 (n = 1,475,406) containing specific institution metadata, it decreased to 54% (n = 816,018) in 2025. Overall, the Walden release contained 1,276,633 fewer articles with affiliation metadata than the previous snapshot analysing the same set of articles published between 2018 and 2025.\nComparing the availability of raw affiliation strings (Panel B) and author metadata (Panel C) shows that the decrease relates to availability of affiliation metadata, but does not extend to data about authors.\n\nBy publisher\nA closer look into the distribution by publishers highlights that in particular Elsevier was affected. Figure 2 shows the absolute number of OpenAlex records by publisher and snapshot, with the three largest publishers distinguished by color from others. The figure shows that while the number of articles published in Wiley journals with institution metadata remains stable across snapshots, the affiliation metadata decreased for Elsevier across all years. For Springer Nature the situation was mixed, with an decrease in 2024, followed by an increase for articles published in 2025 after the introduction of Walden.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 – Availability of institution entity in OpenAlex works by publisher and snapshot. Note that only journals included in current transformative agreements negotiated by the Swedish BIBSAM consortium were investigated.\n\n\nA potential explanation is that Elsevier and Springer Nature do not share affiliation metadata via Crossref while Wiley does, according to the Crossref participation report (see Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley). However, the decrease in articles for Elsevier journals was even greater following the release of Walden for the same set of articles, spanning all years. A noticeable decrease can also be observed in the September 2025 version beginning with the publication year 2024. This suggests that OpenAlex is having issues with providing affiliation metadata for Elsevier articles, in particular after the Walden release.\n\n\nA closer look into Elsevier\nFigure 3 shows the relative decrease in coverage over the years for Elsevier. In the most recent Walden snapshot, OpenAlex recorded institution metadata for just 6.3% of articles published in 2025 by Elsevier journals, contributing the most to the decrease, although other publishers are affected. The September 2025 version also shows a marked decline from 2024 onwards. Before the September 2025 OpenAlex snapshot recorded affiliation metadata for 94% of Elsevier articles published in 2023 and even 96% for the publication year 2020. This trend aligns with the availability of raw affiliation strings in OpenAlex.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 – Elsevier: Availability of institution entity in OpenAlex works by snapshot.

    "text": "Looking ahead\nTo account for possible changes since the Walden snapshot release, 500 Elsevier articles published in 2025 without affiliation metadata were queried using the OpenAlex API on 15 December. The results show that around one-fourth of the articles now have affiliation metadata recorded in OpenAlex, so the situation is likely to change with the next release. However, this percentage is close to that reported for the September 2025 snapshot, which is still much lower than for previous years and only comprises a third of articles from this major publisher published in 2025."

    "text": "Discussion and conclusion\nAnalysing the coverage of affiliation metadata in OpenAlex revealed a substantial decrease, presumably due to some publishers not providing affiliation metadata to Crossref, as well as potential technical issues within OpenAlex itself, which can partly be attributed to the transition to Walden. In particular, articles published in 2025 lacked affilation metadata in Crossref. Elsevier, the largest publisher in our sample, stands out in particular.\nThe observed decrease is critical for numerous institutional and country-specific research and monitoring activities making use of OpenAlex. In the case of the Hybrid Open Access Dashboard, I must alert users against relying on this data from 2024 onwards. I will carefully observe developments and hope that this issue can be resolved. Therefore, I have written this long-form issue description. Everyone is free to replicate these findings as the two latest OpenAlex snapshots used for this analysis are publicly available on Google BigQuery, as provided by the SUB Göttingen."

    "text": "Data and Method\nThe following analysis is based on data from OpenAlex (Snapshot 08/2025) and Semantic Scholar (Snapshot 02/2025). Data was accessed via the data warehouse of the SUB Göttingen which is powered by Google BigQuery.\nThe present study focuses on articles and reviews in journals. For convenience, journal items were only filtered by the document and publication type from OpenAlex. In addition, the publication year from OpenAlex was used. Journal items were matched via the Digital Object Identifier (DOI). The analysis covers journal items from 2015 to 2023. To obtain the number of references from the respective data sources, the precomputed field was used (for example in Semantic Scholar: ‘referencecount’). However, sometimes the precalculated number may differ from the actual number of references contained in a database. For example, a journal article has a reference count of 18, but all references are missing in the database because the publisher decided to omit this information. In this case, I have to calculate the so-called source reference count.\nThe source reference count in Semantic Scholar was retrieved by counting items in the field ‘references’ that refer to other items within Semantic Scholar. Unlike the reference count, the actual references from Semantic Scholar are not contained in the data warehouse of the SUB Göttingen, but in an external dataset (available through the Semantic Scholar Datasets API). Because the Semantic Scholar reference dataset is quite large (about 1 TB), I made use of the High Performance Cluster of the GWDG Göttingen to calculate the number of source references. For this purpose, I wrote a Python script that performs this task. The aggregated data was then loaded into BigQuery. Retrieving the source reference count in OpenAlex is far simpler, as OpenAlex only considers the source reference count (field: ‘referenced_works_count’)."

    "text": "Results\nFigure 1a displays a comparison of reference counts in Semantic Scholar and OpenAlex for the publication years 2015 to 2023, based on a shared corpus of approximately 37,5 million journal articles. Reference counts precalculated by Semantic Scholar are shown with a dashed line. It can be seen that the precalculated reference count in Semantic Scholar exceeds the number counted in OpenAlex for the publication years 2015 to 2019, but drops slightly afterwards. The number of source references in Semantic Scholar is lower across all publication years than in OpenAlex. In total, 982,585,826 references were counted in OpenAlex and 994,263,247 references were precalculated in Semantic Scholar. The number of source references in Semantic Scholar totals 896,752,043. Note that, although OpenAlex appears to have a greater number of source references than Semantic Scholar, I found about 9 million journal articles with more source references in Semantic Scholar than in OpenAlex (for the chosen time period).\nIn contrast to Figure 1a, Figure 1b shows a comparison of average reference counts in Semantic Scholar and OpenAlex. Again, reference counts precalculated by Semantic Scholar are shown with a dashed line. While the figure shows the same trends as in Figure 1a, a slight decline in the average reference figures can be observed from 2021 onwards. On average, OpenAlex counts 25.52 references per journal item, while Semantic Scholar counts 25.83 references and 23.29 source references per article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of references in OpenAlex and Semantic Scholar based on a shared corpus.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to examine the differences between Semantic Scholar and OpenAlex in more detail, I will assign the precalculated reference and source reference count to publishers (see Figure 3a and 3b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Comparison of references per publisher in Semantic Scholar and OpenAlex.\n\n\n\n\n\nI also compiled a list of the most common publishers for which OpenAlex or Semantic Scholar has a larger source reference count (see Table 1 and 2). Here, it can be seen that OpenAlex deposits more source references for the publishers Elsevier (about 12,600,000 references), Springer (about 916,000 references) and Wiley (about 746,000 references) than Semantic Scholar. On the contrary, Semantic Scholar has more source references for the publishers Frontiers Media (about 800,000 references), SAGE (about 512,000 references) and Taylor & Francis (about 269,000 references).\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: The 10 most frequently appearing publishers for which OpenAlex has a higher source reference count than Semantic Scholar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noal_source_ref_sum\ns2_source_ref_sum\npublisher_id\npublisher_name\ndiff\n\n\n\n\n221,098,550\n208,460,916\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310320990\nElsevier BV\n12,637,634\n\n\n58,524,445\n46,853,039\nNone\nNone\n11,671,406\n\n\n91,912,174\n82,755,155\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310319900\nSpringer Science+Business Media\n9,157,019\n\n\n75,121,716\n67,664,721\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310320595\nWiley\n7,456,995\n\n\n25,816,934\n21,628,791\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310320006\nAmerican Chemical Society\n4,188,143\n\n\n18,203,600\n14,255,451\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310320556\nRoyal Society of Chemistry\n3,948,149\n\n\n19,562,074\n15,847,098\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310311648\nOxford University Press\n3,714,976\n\n\n9,996,522\n6,651,643\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310320261\nAmerican Physical Society\n3,344,879\n\n\n17,313,110\n15,205,127\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310320256\nBioMed Central\n2,107,983\n\n\n15,143,213\n13,396,255\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310319965\nSpringer Nature\n1,746,958\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: The 10 most frequently appearing publishers for which Semantic Scholar has a higher source reference count than OpenAlex (surplus represented by a minus)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noal_source_ref_sum\ns2_source_ref_sum\npublisher_id\npublisher_name\ndiff\n\n\n\n\n27,245,366\n28,043,664\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310320527\nFrontiers Media\n-798,298\n\n\n6,050,726\n6,629,422\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310319811\nEmerald Publishing Limited\n-578,696\n\n\n19,780,360\n20,292,611\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310320017\nSAGE Publishing\n-512,251\n\n\n707,064\n1,069,281\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310320466\nOMICS Publishing Group\n-362,217\n\n\n38,428,778\n38,697,631\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310320547\nTaylor & Francis\n-268,853\n\n\n349,881\n612,388\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310320855\nSciencedomain International\n-262,507\n\n\n6,447,765\n6,696,983\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310319869\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\n-249,218\n\n\n1,507,041\n1,719,281\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310319798\nAssociation for Computing Machinery\n-212,240\n\n\n1,493,723\n1,655,240\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310317820\nKarger Publishers\n-161,517\n\n\n2,069,755\n2,221,403\nhttps://openalex.org/P4310320000\nThieme Medical Publishers (Germany)\n-151,648\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, I will compare the reference and source reference count in Semantic Scholar and OpenAlex by using topics from OpenAlex (see Table 3 and Table 4). I choose the primary topic domain for this purpose (which comprises the domains Health Sciences, Social Sciences, Life Sciences and Physical Sciences). For health sciences, Semantic Scholar counts on average 22,4 source references per article, while OpenAlex counts 23,9 source references. This differs slightly from the precomputed references count, where Semantic Scholar exceeds the reference count of OpenAlex by 24,1 to 23,9 references. The same applies to the social sciences, where the number of references precalculated by Semantic Scholar is greater than in the case of OpenAlex. However, when looking at the average number of source references, OpenAlex surpasses Semantic Scholar (16,0 to 14,5 source references on average).\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: References contained in OpenAlex and precalculated by Semantic Scholar per OpenAlex domain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noal_ref_sum\noal_ref_avg\ns2_ref_sum\ns2_ref_avg\nprimary_topic\n\n\n\n\n191,680,092\n36.625827\n190,953,855\n36.487059\nLife Sciences\n\n\n235,953,838\n23.902660\n237,839,461\n24.093678\nHealth Sciences\n\n\n407,198,668\n31.643654\n400,246,309\n31.103382\nPhysical Sciences\n\n\n145,744,398\n16.035306\n163,572,762\n17.996845\nSocial Sciences\n\n\n2,008,830\n1.398958\n1,650,860\n1.149666\nNone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Source references contained in OpenAlex and Semantic Scholar per OpenAlex domain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noal_source_ref_sum\noal_source_ref_avg\ns2_source_ref_sum\ns2_source_ref_avg\nprimary_topic\n\n\n\n\n191,680,092\n36.625827\n177,680,421\n33.950799\nLife Sciences\n\n\n235,953,838\n23.902660\n221,164,605\n22.404477\nHealth Sciences\n\n\n407,198,668\n31.643654\n364,822,452\n28.350572\nPhysical Sciences\n\n\n145,744,398\n16.035306\n132,044,159\n14.527958\nSocial Sciences\n\n\n2,008,830\n1.398958\n1,040,406\n0.724543\nNone"

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis analysis demonstrates interesting differences between the reference counts in OpenAlex and Semantic Scholar. In particular, discrepancies were found between publishers, with Semantic Scholar counting more references than OpenAlex for publishers like Taylor & Francis and BMJ. The proportion of source references is higher in OpenAlex than in Semantic Scholar, although about 9 million journal articles were identified for which the source reference count was greater than in OpenAlex. This finding is quite relevant for bibliometric research, as it may enable more accurate citation analysis in OpenAlex, which can be achieved through the inclusion of open metadata.\nDuring my analysis, I also discovered some inconsistencies between the Semantic Scholar website and its API. For example, references for some journal articles are missing in the API but are shown on the website. In other cases, references are missing in the API with the note: “Notice: The following paper fields have been elided by the publisher: {‘references’}”. However, this observation was not analysed further."
