{"title":"Introducing Open Metadata about Transformative Agreements","markdown":{"headingText":"Introducing Open Metadata about Transformative Agreements","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nMay 9, 2025 \n\nNajko Jahn\n\nThis post presents a new dataset that combines open metadata from the\ncOAlition S Journal Checker Tool and OpenAlex to analyse transformative\nagreements. Data on these much-discussed agreements are scattered across\ndifferent sources and are only partially available. To address this, we\npreserved and combined open metadata from the cOAlition S Journal\nChecker Tool and OpenAlex, resulting in a unified dataset for\nlarge-scale bibliometric studies.\n\n[Read more](posts/openbib_ta_release/)\n\n## Changes in evidence for green open access in Scopus\n\nDec. 16, 2024\n\nSophia Dörner\n\nIn March 2024, Scopus announced changes to its open access tagging\npolicy to better align with the Unpaywall definitions. In this blog\npost, I examine the impact of the policy change by comparing three\nScopus snapshots, comprising around 20 million records. Although the\noverall share of open access did not change, the analysis found a\ndecrease in the number of copies in repositories, affecting about 2\nmillion items, that cannot be explained by Unpaywall changes.\n\n[Read more](posts/scopus_oa_tagging_changes/)\n\n\n## Identifying journal article types in OpenAlex\n\nOct. 24, 2024\n\nNick Haupka\n\nIdentifying suitable types of journal articles for bibliometric analyses\nis important. In this blog post, I present a document type classifier\nthat helps to identify research contributions like original research\narticles using Crossref and OpenAlex. The classifier and classified\nOpenAlex records are openly available.\n\n[Read more](posts/oal_document_types_classifier/)\n\n\n## Recent Changes in Document type classification in OpenAlex compared to Web of Science and Scopus\n\nSept. 4, 2024\n\nNick Haupka | Sophia Dörner | Najko Jahn\n\nIn June 2024, we published a preprint on the classification of document\ntypes in OpenAlex and compared it with the scholarly databases Web of\nScience, Scopus, PubMed and Semantic Scholar. In this follow-up study,\nwe want to investigate further developments in OpenAlex and compare the\nresults with the proprietary databases Scopus and Web of Science.\n\n[Read more](posts/openalex_document_types/)\n\n## Analysing and reclassifying open access information in OpenAlex\n\nNov. 7, 2023\n\nNajko Jahn | Nick Haupka | Anne Hobert\n\nWe investigated OpenAlex and found over four million records with\nincompatible metadata about open access works. To illustrate this issue,\nwe applied Unpaywall\\'s methodology to OpenAlex data. The comparative\nanalysis revealed a shift, with over one million journal articles\npublished in 2023 that were previously labelled as \\\"closed\\\" in\nOpenAlex, being reclassified as \\\"gold\\\", \\\"hybrid\\\", \\\"green\\\", or\n\\\"bronze\\\".\n\n\n[Read more](posts/oalex_oa_status/)\n\n## How open are hybrid journals included in nationwide transformative agreements in Germany?\n\nJune 7, 2022\n\nNajko Jahn \n\n\n[Read more](posts/oam_hybrid/)\n\nWe present hoaddata, an experimental R package that combines open\nscholarly data from the German Open Access Monitor, Crossref and\nOpenAlex. Using this package, we illustrate the progress made in\npublishing open access content in hybrid journals included in nationwide\ntransformative agreements in Germany across journal portfolios and\ncountries.\n\n[Read more](posts/oam_hybrid/)\n\n\n## Accessing and analysing the OpenAIRE Research Graph data dumps\n\nApril 7, 2020\n\nNajko Jahn\n\nThe OpenAIRE Research Graph provides a wide range of metadata about\ngrant-supported research publications. This blog post presents an\nexperimental R package with helpers for splitting, de-compressing and\nparsing the underlying data dumps. I will demonstrate how to use them by\nexamining the compliance of funded projects with the open access mandate\nin Horizon 2020.\n\n[Read more](posts/oaire_graph_2020/){.post-preview}\n\n## Exploring the Open Access Evidence Base in Unpaywall with Python\n\nMarch 30, 2020\n\nNick Haupka\n\nOpen Access evidence sources constantly change. In this blog post, I\npresent a Python based approach for analysing the most recent snapshots\nfrom the open access discovery service Unpaywall. Results shows a growth\nin open access content, partly because of newly introduced evidence\nsources like Semantic Scholar.\n\n[Read more](posts/unpaywall_python/)\n\n## Mining and analysing invoice data from Elsevier relative to hybrid open access\n\nNov. 25, 2019\n\nNajko Jahn\n\nPublishers rarely make publication fee spending for hybrid journals\ntransparent. Elsevier is a remarkable exception, as the publisher\nprovides open and machine-readable data relative to its central\ninvoicing with funding bodies and fee waivers at the article level. This\nblogpost illustrates how to mine Elsevier full-texts for these data with\nthe data science tool R and presents new insights by analysing the\nresulting dataset: of 70,657 articles published open access in 1,753\nhybrid journals from 2015 to date, around one third of the publication\nfees were paid through central agreements. Nevertheless, the majority of\nfunding sources for hybrid open access remains unclear.\n\n[Read more](posts/elsevier_invoice/)\n\n## Interfacing the DataCite PID Graph with R\n\nOct. 24, 2019\n\nNajko Jahn\n\nThe PID Graph from DataCite interlinks persistent identifiers (PID) in\nresearch. In this blog post, I will present how to interface this graph\nusing the DataCite GraphQL API with R. To illustrate it, I will\nvisualise the research information network of a person.\n\n[Read more](posts/datacite_graph/)\n\n## Open Access Evidence in Unpaywall\n\nMay 7, 2019\n\nNajko Jahn | Anne Hobert\n\nWe investigated more than 31 million scholarly journal articles\npublished between 2008 and 2018 that are indexed in Unpaywall, a widely\nused open access discovery tool. Using Google BigQuery and R, we\ndetermined over 11.6 million journal articles with open access full-text\nlinks in Unpaywall, corresponding to an open access share of 37 %. Our\ndata analysis revealed various open access location and evidence types,\nas well as large overlaps between them, raising important questions\nabout how to responsibly re-use Unpaywall data in bibliometric research\nand open access monitoring.\n\n[Read
