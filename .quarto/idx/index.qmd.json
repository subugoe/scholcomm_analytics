Being part of the [Knowledge Commons](https://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/kontakt/abteilungen-a-z/abteilungs-und-gruppendetails/abteilunggruppe/wissen-als-gemeingut/) group, we support the [State and University Library of Göttingen](https://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/sub-aktuell/) and the [University of Göttingen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/) by providing data-driven insights into current trends in scholarly communication.\n\nWe use various bibliometric databases and maintain a publicly accessible data warehouse for open scholarly data, which is based on Google Cloud BigQuery. We also provide software clients to programmatically access open metadata sources using R and Python.\n\nOn our blog, we publish initial data case studies.
